      <p>New York City is largely surrounded by water, residing on a collection of islands and peninsulas. Access to the water was fundamental to the establishment of a city here, and waterfront property was historically dedicated to industrial and transportation functions. In more modern times, manufacturing has declined in importance, replaced by white collar businesses, and modern transportation systems are no longer reliant on access to the water.</p>
        <p>Waterfront property has increasingly been rededicated towards recreational uses and premium residential development. However, there remains a large parcel of land along the Brooklyn waterfront still earmarked for industry, with modern manufacturing enterprises operating alongside traditional waterfront businesses which would have been recognizable to our ancestors living in the city two hundred years ago. This is the Brooklyn Navy Yard.</p>

<p>The Navy Yard is own by the city and managed by a non-profit corporation. The previous President of the organization described the organization’s mission as “to create high quality
middle class jobs in the manufacturing and industrial sector and connect local residents to those jobs.”</p>

    <p><b>Ferry landing:</b> In old New York, transportation between the boroughs could only be accomplished by ferry boat. With the advent of bridges and tunnels, ferry traffic is no longer as critical. However, NYC Ferry currently runs ferries from Manhattan and Queens which stop at the Navy Yard.</p>
